## Worm Bin

### Setup
- Tote bin
- Worms (Red Wigglers preferred for indoor bins)
- CardBoard
- New Paper
- Coco coir to start with (need only for first time setup). Can be substituted with Dry leaves. I was concerned bringing insects from Outside.

### Maintenance
- Daily: Separate out food scraps (Except Onion, Tomatoes, Lime/Lemons, Citrus fruits, Garlic, Pepper, etc)
